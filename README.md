RVS_BTDriver (in GitHub as RVS_GTDriver, for Historical Reasons)
=
This project is an open-source, low-level native Cocoa ([iOS](https://apple.com/ios), [macOS](https://apple.com/macos), [watchOS](https:apple.com/watchos) and [tvOS](https://apple.com/tvos)) [BLE (**B**luetooth **L**ow **E**nergy)](https://www.bluetooth.com) driver for mesh communication devices, like the  [goTenna](https://gotenna.com) devices.

WHERE THIS DRIVER FITS
=

![Overall Image](./img/SystemBlock.png)
This is where the driver project fits in our system.

The driver is a low-level transport abstraction layer. It is Bluetooth-specific, but is designed to abstract between [Bluetooth LE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_Low_Energy) and Bluetooth BR/EDR ("Classic"); presenting a common object model of data and interactions with Bluetooth devices.

NOT A DEVICE DRIVER 
-
RVS_BTDriver is a low-level native Swift (Apple) driver. It is not a "device driver," which usually sit at an operating system level (kernel or user space). It is designed to translate between a bluetooth connection to a device, and a user application; presenting an object model of the device.

CENTRAL MANAGER
-
The driver will act as [a Bluetooth LE "central Manager" (GATT Client)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corebluetooth/cbcentralmanager) only. It will not present itself as [a peripheral](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corebluetooth/cbperipheral).

SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

The general class and protocol structure of the system.

SIMPLE API
-
The job of the driver is to *abstract* the general Bluetooth structure, and present a set of [Swift Protocols](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Protocols.html), in a hierarchical arrangement.

The user of the API will instantiate an instance of RVS_BTDriver, which will, in turn, present collections of "devices" (RVS_BTDriver_DeviceProtocol), which will contain "Services" (RVS_BTDriver_ServiceProtocol), which will aggregate "properties" (RVS_BTDriver_PropertyProtocol).

EXAMPLE MENTAL MODEL OF THE DRIVER
-
![Block Diagram](./img/MentalModel.png)
This is an example of how the driver might present three goTenna devices (two Mesh devices and a Pro).

REQUIREMENTS
-
The Driver is provided as a [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/)-only shared dynamic [framework](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPFrameworks/Frameworks.html).

This is meant for [iOS](https://www.apple.com/ios/), [macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/), [watchOS](https://www.apple.com/watchos/), [tvOS](https://www.apple.com/tvos/) and [ipadOS](https://www.apple.com/ipados/) only.
